Phase 1: MinilibX Fundamentals - Getting Pixels on Screen (Easy)
Objective: Understand how to open a window, create an image buffer, and draw individual pixels.

Window Initialization:

Initialize the MinilibX system.

Create a new window with a predefined width and height (e.g., 640x480 pixels).

Give the window a title (e.g., "My First MinilibX Window").

Image Buffer Creation:

Create a new image buffer in memory that MinilibX can draw to.

Obtain a pointer to the raw pixel data of this image buffer.

Retrieve the image's bits-per-pixel (BPP) and line-size (number of bytes per row) for later pixel manipulation.

Pixel Drawing Function:

Implement a function that takes X and Y coordinates and a color value (e.g., 0xRRGGBB format) as input.

This function should calculate the correct byte offset in the raw image data based on X, Y, BPP, and line-size.

It should then write the individual Red, Green, and Blue color components into the corresponding bytes at that offset.

Displaying the Image:

After drawing some pixels (e.g., a simple colored square or a diagonal line) using your pixel drawing function, put the entire image buffer onto the created window.

Event Loop & Window Closure:

Start the MinilibX event loop to keep the window open and responsive.

Implement a hook to handle the window close event (e.g., clicking the 'X' button) to gracefully shut down MinilibX and exit the program.

Phase 2: Static Raycasting - Your First 3D View (Medium)
Objective: Implement the core raycasting logic to render a simple 3D scene from a fixed viewpoint onto your MinilibX window.

Map Representation:

Define a small, fixed 2D grid map in your program (e.g., a 5x5 or 10x10 character array or integer array).

Use specific values (e.g., 0 for empty space, 1 for a wall) to represent the maze structure.

Camera Setup:

Define a fixed player position (X, Y coordinates on the map).

Define a fixed player direction vector (e.g., facing directly East).

Define a fixed camera plane vector, perpendicular to the player's direction, which sets the field of view.

Main Raycasting Loop (Per-Column):

Implement a loop that iterates for each vertical column of pixels on your screen.

For each screen column, calculate the specific ray direction.

Ray Traversal (DDA Algorithm):

For each ray, implement a Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm.

This algorithm should efficiently step through the map grid squares along the ray's path.

It should determine:

Which wall the ray hits first.

The exact point of intersection on the wall.

The distance from the player to that wall.

Which "side" of the wall (e.g., North, South, East, West) was hit.

Perspective Projection (Wall Height):

Calculate the perpendicular distance to the wall to avoid fisheye distortion.

Use this perpendicular distance to calculate the projected height of the wall slice on the screen.

Determine the start and end pixel rows on the screen where the wall slice should be drawn.

Basic Wall Drawing:

Draw the calculated vertical wall slice using your pixel drawing function from Phase 1.

Use a fixed color for all walls (e.g., 0xFF0000 for red walls).

Optionally, color the top part (ceiling) and bottom part (floor) of the column with different fixed colors.

Rendering Loop:

Integrate your raycasting logic into a continuous rendering loop (using mlx_loop_hook). This will draw the 3D scene repeatedly.

Phase 3: Basic Player Interaction & Movement (Medium-Hard)
Objective: Allow the player to move and rotate within the 3D environment.

Player State Management:

Store player position (X, Y), direction (X, Y components), and camera plane (X, Y components) in a struct.

Keyboard Hooks for Movement:

Implement mlx_hook for KeyPress and KeyRelease events.

Map specific keys (e.g., 'W' for forward, 'S' for backward, 'A' for turn left, 'D' for turn right) to actions.

When a key is pressed, update the player's position and/or direction vectors appropriately. Ensure collision detection with walls (don't let the player move into map cells marked as walls).

Continuous Movement:

Modify your draw_loop (from mlx_loop_hook) to not only redraw the scene but also to apply pending movement/rotation updates based on currently pressed keys. This provides smooth continuous motion.

Phase 4: Enhanced Rendering - Textures & Shading (Hard)
Objective: Add visual detail by applying textures to walls and basic shading.

Texture Loading:

Load multiple distinct image files (e.g., .xpm files) as textures using MinilibX's image loading functions.

Store the pixel data for these textures.

Texture Mapping (for walls):

When a ray hits a wall, determine:

Which texture to apply (based on wall type in your map, or which side was hit).

The exact X-coordinate on the texture that corresponds to the hit point on the wall.

During wall rendering, for each vertical pixel of the wall slice:

Calculate the corresponding Y-coordinate on the texture.

Sample the color from the chosen texture at the calculated (texture X, texture Y) coordinates.

Draw that sampled color pixel to the screen.

Basic Shading:

Apply basic distance-based shading: The farther a wall, the darker its rendered color.

Implement side-based shading: Make vertical walls (East/West-facing) slightly darker or lighter than horizontal walls (North/South-facing) to give a sense of depth.

Floor and Ceiling Colors:

Instead of single fixed colors, implement more distinct floor and ceiling colors. Optionally, differentiate between the top and bottom half of the screen.

Phase 5: Map Design and Level Loading (Harder)
Objective: Allow loading maps from external files and handle multiple levels.

Map File Format:

Define a simple text-based file format for your maps (e.g., lines of characters representing rows, where '1' is wall, '0' is empty, 'P' is player start).

Include metadata like player start position and initial direction within the file.

Map Parsing:

Implement a function to read and parse a map file.

Validate the map structure (e.g., rectangular, surrounded by walls, valid characters).

Store the parsed map data in your program's data structure.

Level Transitions (Optional):

Define conditions for moving between levels (e.g., reaching a specific exit point on the map).

Implement logic to load a new map when these conditions are met.

Phase 6: Advanced Features (Very Hard / Bonus)
Objective: Push the boundaries of raycasting with more complex elements.

Sprites:

Implement rendering for 2D "sprites" (e.g., enemies, items) that float in the 3D space.

This involves drawing them after walls, correctly scaling them based on their distance, and handling their visibility (e.g., hiding parts behind walls).

Doors:

Implement functional doors that can be opened/closed (e.g., by pressing a key when facing them).

This requires dynamic changes to your map data and potentially animating the door's opening/closing.

Minimap:

Render a small 2D overhead map in a corner of your screen showing the player's position, direction, and visible walls.

More Complex Shading/Lighting:

Implement simple light sources (e.g., torches) that cast more localized light onto walls.

Consider different wall textures for different sides of the map.

Mouse Look:

Implement mouse input to allow the player to look around freely (rotate camera). This might involve locking the mouse cursor to the window.
